# ODISE: Open-Vocabulary Panoptic Segmentation with Text-to-Image Diffusion Models

ODISE: Open-vocabulary DIffusion-based panoptic SEgmentation exploits pre-trained text-image diffusion and discriminative models to perform open-vocabulary panoptic segmentation. It leverages the frozen representation of both these models to perform panoptic segmentation of any category in the wild.
I have tested model on the colad which is great work in imgage segmentation area the origenal code the project wesite was not working so I impelment it in this way and high recomned to read the origenal repasetory
